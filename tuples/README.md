# [Tuples](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/Python/tree/main/collection/tuples.py)
- similar to list but immutable (can not be changed/mutated)
- have less method than lists
- defined by parenthesis `()`
- each element separated by comma
- can be accessed by `tuple[index]`
- index started from zero
- minus index will start from the last element
- `adding tuples`: use `+` to create a new tuples from combined two values of tuples together
- `multiplying tuples`: use `*` to create a new tuples with repeated value of tuples multiple times
